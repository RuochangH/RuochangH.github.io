    <h1>Divvy Bike-share Station Hourly Departure Projection</h1>
      <div class="slide1">
        <div id="intro">
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p class="intro">In  2013, the city of Chicago lauched
            <a href="https://www.divvybikes.com">Divvy bike share system</a>.
            As a new mode that facilitates short distance travels and transit rides,
            the system is popular across the town. However, the unbalanced bike flows hamper
            the operation and expansion of the system. On the one hand, it results in full
            or empty station frequently, downgrading the reliability of the system.
            On the other hand, bike reallocation, solution to this problem, is based on
            real-time activity, which is costy and lagging behind.</p>
          <p class="intro">While the unbalanced bike flow is inherented, pro-active reallocation has the potential
            to reduce the cost and reduce loss of customers. Therefore, this project is designed to
            build a OLS model to project the hourly departure for 147 stations near downtown Loop.</p>
          <hr></hr>
          <h2>Model Building</h2>
          <p>The model was built on 147 stations near downtown Chicago for the second week of June in 2017, because there
            are greater rebalancing demand due to the prominent commuting patterns in warm days. During model building
            process, candidate predictors are selected based on their explanatory power and the selection was finalized
            by model generalizability suggested by cross-validation</p>
          <p>Before start, take a look at the accumulated departures in each stations for a weekday</p>

      <h2>Observe Hourly Departure Difference Across Locations and Times</h2>
      <p>To build the predictive model for hourly departures, the biggest challenge is that the our dependent variables
          are highly spatial- and serial- correlated because demands are usually concentrated in certain time period and location.</p>

        <h2>Predictors: Station Area Predictor Exploration</h2>
        <p>Apart from the previously mentioned lag variables, the model also includes socio-economic and bike network
          characteristics of station areas, distance to and average ridership of nearest transit stations for each
          bike station, and time of depatures. They are all theoritically related to bike trip demand. </p>
        <p>This page takes a deeper look at station area variables, including employment and population density, median
          household income, and number of Transit Stations within station area. Station area is
          defined by 0.5-mile buffer around stations. The origional data comes from ACS census, and Chicago Open Data,
          and they are summarized and exported in ArcGIS through Spatial Join.</p>
        <p>The sizes of the each point show the number of the departures total and the color of the each point illustrate
          the value of station area predictors.

        <h2>Prediction Results</h2>
        <p>After throwing all lag variables and station area variables, we use stepwise regression, Anova test,and cross
          validation to compare and get the final selection of variables. The final model has an adjusted R-square of 0.702,
          which means 70% of the variations in our dependent variable are explained by our model. It is significant under
          0.05 confidence level. The VIF test of all included variables are less than 5, suggesting that there is no
          significant multicollinarity in our independent variables too.</p>
        <p>In terms of generalizability, we use 100-fold cross validation that subsets the data to 100 folders and uses 99
          of them as training sets to test the other for 100 times. The mean R-squares of these 100 folds is 0.680,
          with 0.117 stardared deviation. The mean absolute error is 1.553, with 0.149 standard deviation. Both of these
          suggesting that the predictive power of our model is consistently high across different observations.

        <h2>Model Residuels</h2>
        <p>For a deeper comparison of the predicted value and observed value, this map illustrates the relationship between
          error and observed hourly departure. The size of the point shows the number of departures, while the color of the point
          illustrates its error. The darker the color, the farther the distance from the observed value. If it's overestimated,
          the color is warmer and vice verse. As you may observed from these maps, our model is comparably poor-performing when
          hourly departure values are high. </p>
        <p>Also, you can choose same hour but different weekdays, or same day different hours (peak or off peak) to check the
          serial correlation of our model. In other words, whether the prediction power is consistent across time. You may
          check the spatial correlations too, simply by observing the spatial color pattern of several plots. If same colors are
          clustered, then spatial correlation exists and vice verse.
